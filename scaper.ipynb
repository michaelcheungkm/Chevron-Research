Soluble sugars function in providing enough supply of nutrients which further helps in building macromolecules and energy to carry out specific and coordinated development. Sugars functions as nutrient as well as signaling molecule to promote cell division and differentiation in plants. Intriguingly, glucose has emerged as a crucial signaling molecule where hexokinase1 acts as the conserved glucose sensor. On the molecular scale, an extensive crosstalk between glucose and phytohormone signaling has been observed where glucose signals trigger multiple hexokinase1-dependent as well as hexokinase1-independent pathways to mediate diverse developmental, physiological and molecular mechanisms. Taken together, these findings this review focused on the glucose crosstalk with several classical plant hormonal-signaling pathways and the crucial role of hexokinase1 in modulating plant physiological processes.',\n",

Considering that a clinician relies heavily on blood (or rarely other body fluid) glucose values for decision making, an understanding of the basic aspects of glucose measurement in body fluids is necessary.\\nMethods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles in English on measurement of glucose in body fluids.\\nResults: Glucose can be measured in several body fluids, namely blood, interstitial fluid, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid and ascitic fluid in appropriate clinical settings. For blood glucose measurement, the present-day enzymatic methods have replaced the older reducing and condensation methods on account of their better accuracy. It is important to consider preanalytical factors such as sample collection, storage and transport when analyzing a laboratory blood glucose report. The measurement of glucose in interstitial fluid using continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) enables better understanding of glucose trends and fluctuations. The CGMS data should be reported using standard metrics which include parameters such as mean 24-h glucose, glycemic variability and time-in, below and above range. The measurement of glucose in urine sample is rarely ever used these days and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances.\\nConclusion: This review provides a detailed account of various aspects of glucose measurement including their evolution, pitfalls, and their utility in current clinical practice.',\n",

Participants were followed up to 24 years, and cardiovascular outcomes were collected from national registers. Predictive abilities of fasting, 1-h, and 2-h glucose were evaluated alone and in the prediction models with traditional cardiovascular risk factors using Cox proportional hazard models, the likelihood-ratio test, Harrell's concordance index and integrated discrimination improvement.\\nResults: Cardiovascular endpoint occurred in 222 (22.7%) participants during a median follow-up of 19.8 years. In the prognostic models, 1-h glucose (HR 1.67, 95%CI 1.10-2.53), but not fasting or 2-h glucose, predicted cardiovascular events statistically significantly. In addition, when adding glucose parameters into the model including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, only 1-h glucose improved the predictive ability (LR-test p=.046).

       "  'title': 'Glucosensing neurons do more than just sense glucose',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"The brain regulates energy homeostasis by balancing energy intake, expenditure and storage. To accomplish this, it has evolved specialized neurons that receive and integrate afferent neural and metabolic signals conveying information about the energy status of the body. These sensor-integrator-effector neurons are located in brain areas involved in homeostatic functions such as the hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, basal ganglia, limbic system and nucleus tractus solitarius. The ability to sense and regulate glucose metabolism is critical because of glucose's primacy as a metabolic substrate for neural function. Most neurons use glucose as an energy substrate, but glucosensing neurons also use glucose as a signaling molecule to regulate neuronal firing and transmitter release. There are two types of glucosensing neurons that either increase (glucose responsive, GR) or decrease (glucose sensitive, GS) their firing rate as brain glucose levels rise. Little is known about the mechanism by which GS neurons sense glucose. However, GR neurons appear to function much like the pancreatic beta-cell where glycolysis regulates the activity of an ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel. The K(ATP) channel is composed of four pore-forming units (Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea binding sites (SUR). Glucokinase (GK) appears to modulate K(ATP) channel activity via its gatekeeper role in the glycolytic production of ATP. Thus, GK may serve as a marker for GR neurons. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are critical components of the energy homeostasis pathways in the brain. Both express Kir6.2 and GK, as well as leptin receptors. They also receive visceral neural and intrinsic neuropeptide and transmitter inputs. Such metabolism-related signals can summate upon K(ATP) channel activity which then alters membrane potential, neuronal firing rate and peptide/transmitter release. The outputs of these neurons are integral components of effector systems which regulate energy homeostasis. Thus, arcuate NPY and POMC neurons are probably prototypes of this important class of sensor-integrator-effector neurons.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'The regulation of glucose effectiveness: how glucose modulates its own production',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Purpose of review: 'Glucose effectiveness' refers to the ability of glucose per se to suppress endogenous glucose production and stimulate glucose uptake. In addition to the inhibitory effects of insulin on endogenous glucose production, rising glucose levels have important direct effects on glucose homeostasis. The loss of glucose effectiveness in type 2 diabetes mellitus contributes importantly to hyperglycemia in those individuals. Given the rapidly increasing incidence and serious complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, understanding the regulation of glucose effectiveness has great potential therapeutic benefits.\\nRecent findings: The loss of this important regulation appears to be secondary to the chronic 'diabetic milieu' in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which includes elevated plasma glucose and free fatty acid levels. Glucose effectiveness is completely restored by normalizing plasma free fatty acid levels. Increased free fatty acid availability stimulates gluconeogenesis and alters flux through key hepatic enzymes. It is likely that at least part of this regulation is through central pathways. In addition, hormones that may exert important effects on hepatic glucose effectiveness include cortisol, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1. The effectiveness of glucose to stimulate glucose uptake is impaired by elevated free fatty acid levels and may be enhanced by glucagon-like peptide 1.\\nSummary: The regulation of glucose effectiveness involves a complex interplay of hormonal and metabolic factors, with free fatty acid and glucoregulatory hormones playing key roles. The loss of this regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus contributes importantly to hyperglycemia, and may largely be caused by increased free fatty acid levels.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Detecting and mapping metabolism in tissues represents a major step in detecting, characterizing, treating and understanding cancers. Recently introduced deuterium metabolic imaging techniques could offer a noninvasive route for the metabolic imaging of animals and humans, based on using 2 H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to detect the uptake of deuterated glucose and the fate of its metabolic products. In this study, 2 H6,6' -glucose was administered to mice cohorts that had been orthotopically implanted with two different models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), involving PAN-02 and KPC cell lines. As the tumors grew, 2 H6,6' -glucose was administered as bolii into the animals' tail veins, and 2 H MRSI images were recorded at 15.2 T. 2D phase-encoded chemical shift imaging experiments could detect a signal from this deuterated glucose immediately after the bolus injection for both the PDAC models, reaching a maximum in the animals' tumors ~ 20 min following administration, and nearly total decay after ~ 40 min. The main metabolic reporter of the cancers was the 2 H3,3' -lactate signal, which MRSI could detect and localize on the tumors when these were 5 mm or more in diameter. Lactate production time traces varied slightly with the animal and tumor model, but in general lactate peaked at times of 60 min or longer following injection, reaching concentrations that were ~ 10-fold lower than those of the initial glucose injection. This 2 H3,3' -lactate signal was only visible inside the tumors. 2 H-water could also be detected as deuterated glucose's metabolic product, increasing throughout the entire time course of the experiment from its ≈10 mM natural abundance background. This water resonance could be imaged throughout the entire abdomen of the animals, including an enhanced presence in the tumor, but also in other organs like the kidney and bladder. These results suggest that deuterium MRSI may serve as a robust, minimally invasive tool for the monitoring of metabolic activity in pancreatic tumors, capable of undergoing clinical translation and supporting decisions concerning treatment strategies. Comparisons with in vivo metabolic MRI experiments that have been carried out in other animal models are presented and their differences/similarities are discussed.\",\n",

Empirical evidence notwithstanding, there is still no universal understanding of KD mechanism(s). An important fact is that the brain is capable of using ketone bodies for fuel. Another critical point is that glucose's functions span beyond its role as an energy substrate, and in most of these functions, glucose is irreplaceable. By acting as a supplementary fuel, ketone bodies may free up glucose for its other crucial and exclusive function. We propose that this glucose-sparing effect of ketone bodies may underlie the effectiveness of KD in epilepsy and major neurodegenerative diseases, which are all characterized by brain glucose hypometabolism.\",\n",

We summarize recent advances in our understanding of regulation of gene expression by glucose.\\nRecent findings: In-vivo and in-vitro experiments demonstrated that glucose regulates the transcription of genes encoding not only lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes but also proteins involved in global cell functions. The molecular mechanisms have begun to be elucidated, and the transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein has emerged as a key actor, at least in liver. More recently, other candidates have been proposed, such as liver X receptors. In pathological situations, altered glycaemic control, as observed in diabetes mellitus, is associated with increased risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications. Recent findings suggest that changes in gene expression occurring in response to hyperglycaemia represent a novel component of glucotoxicity.\\nSummary: Until recently, the direct transcriptional effects of glucose were underestimated, and insulin was considered to be the major regulator of gene expression in response to glycaemic variation. The recent discovery and characterization of transcription factors mediating the glucose response demonstrate that glucose, like fatty acids and other key nutrients, can directly control gene expression.',\n",

Our results reveal that from the initially populated S1 and S2 states, glucose returns nonradiatively to the ground state within about 200 fs. This takes place mainly via conical intersections (CIs), whose geometries in most cases involve the elongation of a single O-H bond, whereas in some instances, ring-opening due to dissociation of a C-O bond is observed. Experimentally, excitation to a distinct excited electronic state is improbable due to the presence of a dense manifold of states bearing similar oscillator strengths. Our FISH simulations, explicitly including a UV laser pulse of 6.43 eV photon energy, reveal that after initial excitation, the population is almost equally spread over several close-lying electronic states. This is followed by a fast nonradiative decay on the time scale of 100-200 fs, with the final return to the ground state proceeding via the S1 state through the same types of CIs as observed in the field-free simulations.',\n",

Two key glucose phosphates are involved, that is, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and α-glucose 1-phosphate (αG1P). The chiral conformation of glucose, G6P, and αG1P plays an essential role in enzyme-mediated conversions. However, few techniques were able to give a direct view of the conformational changes from glucose to G6P and αG1P. Here, Raman optical activity (ROA) was used to elucidate the stereochemical evolution of glucose upon phosphorylation. ROA was found to be extremely sensitive to different phosphorylation sites. A characteristic ROA marker of (+)980 cm-1, originated from the phosphate group symmetric stretching vibration, is observed for αG1P with phosphorylation at chiral C1, while no corresponding ROA signal for G6P with phosphorylation at achiral C6 is observed. Phosphorylation-induced gauch-gauch (gg)/gauch-trans (gt) rotamer distribution changes can be sensitively probed by the sign of the ROA band around 1460 cm-1. A positive ROA band at 1465 cm-1 of glucose corresponds to a higher gt ratio, while a negative band at 1455 cm-1 of G6P suggests a dominant gg population, and the disappearance of this ROA band for αG1P indicates a nearly balanced gg/gt distribution. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation at C6 and C1 could cause dramatic reduction of the conformational flexibility of the adjacent C4-OH and C2-OH, respectively. These stereochemical changes revealed by ROA spectra offer a structural basis on the understanding of sugar phosphorylation from the perspective of chirality.',\n",

Differences in metabolism of labeled glucoses can be used to quantify physical and chemical recycling of glucose. Only physical recycling is measured by [1-3H]-L-glucose, whereas [U-14C]-D-glucose measures total recycling. The difference between [1-3H]-L-glucose and [U-14C]-D-glucose, therefore, is chemical recycling. Recycling from extracellular binding sites and hepatic glucose 6-phosphate can be measured by difference between [1,2-3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose and [1-3H]-L-glucose, and the difference in irreversible loss of the two will measure extrahepatic uptake of D-glucose. Recycling via Cori-alanine cycle plus CO2 is the difference in irreversible loss measured by using [6-3H]-glucose and [U-14C]-D-glucose. Recycling via the hexose monophosphate pathway can be determined by difference in irreversible loss between [1-3H]-D-glucose and [6-3H]-D-glucose. Recycling via CO2 and glycerol must be measured directly with [U-14C]glucose, bicarbonate, and glycerol. Recycling via hepatic glycogen can be estimated by subtracting all other measured chemical recycling from total chemical recycling.

       "  'abstract': 'The glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase has structural, kinetic, and molecular genetic features that are ideal for its primary role as glucose sensor in a network of neuro/endocrine sentinel cells that maintain glucose homeostasis in many vertebrates including humans. The glucokinase-containing, insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas take the prominent lead in this network, functioning in the aggregate as the master gland. The beta-cells are also conceptualized as the prototype for all other glucose sensor cells, which determines our current understanding of many extrapancreatic glucose sensors. About 99% of the enzyme resides, however, in the hepato-parenchymal cells and serves its second role in a high-capacity process of blood glucose clearance. Two examples strikingly illustrate how pivotal a position glucokinase has in the regulation of glucose metabolism: 1) activating and inactivating mutations of the enzyme cause hypo- and hyperglycemia syndromes in humans described collectively as \"glucokinase disease\" and fully explained by the glucose sensor paradigm, and 2) glucokinase activator drugs (GKAs) have been discovered that bind to an allosteric site and increase the kcat and lower the glucose S(0.5) of the enzyme. GKAs enhance glucose-stimulated insulin release from pancreatic islets and glucose disposition by the liver. They are now intensively explored to develop a novel treatment for diabetes.

The glucose tolerance test measures the ability of an organism to regulate blood glucose levels. Glucose half-life time (GHLT) has high heritability and could serve as a potential parameter to breed for metabolic resistance. However, studies focusing on identification of an adequate glucose dose have not yet been conducted in cattle. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of 5 different glucose doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 g/kg of body weight0.75) on intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) traits and insulin responses in nongestating heifers. A total of 150 tests were performed in 30 Holstein-Friesian heifers aged 13 to 15 mo. Blood samples were obtained every 7 min after glucose injection until min 63. Glucose traits and insulin parameters included blood serum glucose and insulin concentration at min 0 (basal concentration), min 7 to 21 (peak glucose and insulin concentration), and min 63 (last sampling) relative to glucose administration, glucose and insulin area under the curve (GAUC and IAUC), and GHLT estimated between min 14 and 42. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured according to the hexokinase colorimetric method and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Generalized linear mixed model was used to test for significant differences in ivGTT traits, insulin responses, and glucose elimination rates (k) over time at different glucose doses. Maximum glucose and insulin concentrations at min 63 increased with higher glucose doses. Significantly lower GHLT were obtained at increasing glucose doses, whereas GAUC and IAUC were significantly higher at increasing doses. The k values were affected by glucose dose and by time interval. Glucose dose greatly affected most ivGTT traits, insulin responses, and glucose elimination rates. Therefore, researchers should standardize their methods to achieve repeatable results and use the same time points for GHLT calculation. Higher glucose doses (≥1.5 g/kg of body weight0.75) triggered glucose concentrations above the glucose renal threshold during the initial 42 min, whereas the lowest glucose concentration failed to induce a maximum insulin response. Further research is necessary to determine an adequate dose inducing maximum insulin responses with minimum renal glucose losses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A novel graphene-based variable capacitor (varactor) that senses glucose based on the quantum capacitance effect was successfully developed. The sensor utilizes a metal-oxide-graphene varactor device structure that is inherently compatible with passive wireless sensing, a key advantage for in vivo glucose sensing. The graphene varactors were functionalized with pyrene-1-boronic acid (PBA) by self-assembly driven by π-π interactions. Successful surface functionalization was confirmed by both Raman spectroscopy and capacitance-voltage characterization of the devices. Through glucose binding to the PBA, the glucose concentration in the buffer solutions modulates the level of electrostatic doping of the graphene surface to different degrees, which leads to capacitance changes and Dirac voltage shifts. These responses to the glucose concentration were shown to be reproducible and reversible over multiple measurement cycles, suggesting promise for eventual use in wireless glucose monitoring.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Extracellular Glucose Depletion as an Indirect Measure of Glucose Uptake in Cells and Tissues Ex Vivo',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'The ongoing worldwide epidemic of diabetes increases the demand for the identification of environmental, nutritional, endocrine, genetic, and epigenetic factors affecting glucose uptake. The measurement of intracellular fluorescence is a widely used method to test the uptake of fluorescently-labeled glucose (FD-glucose) in cells in vitro, or for imaging glucose-consuming tissues in vivo. This assay assesses glucose uptake at a chosen time point. The intracellular analysis assumes that the metabolism of FD-glucose is slower than that of endogenous glucose, which participates in catabolic and anabolic reactions and signaling. However, dynamic glucose metabolism also alters uptake mechanisms, which would require kinetic measurements of glucose uptake in response to different factors. This article describes a method for measuring extracellular FD-glucose depletion and validates its correlation with intracellular FD-glucose uptake in cells and tissues ex vivo. Extracellular glucose depletion may be potentially applicable for high-throughput kinetic and dose-dependent studies, as well as identifying compounds with glycemic activity and their tissue-specific effects.',\n",

Blood glucose analyzer and CL glucose differences were evaluated if they were both drawn either within ±15 or ±5 minutes. Glucose differences were assessed graphically and quantitatively with simple run charts and the surveillance error grid (SEG) and quantitatively with the 2016 Food and Drug Administration guidance document, with ISO 15197 and SEG statistical summaries. As the GEM glucose exhibits diurnal variation, CL-arterial blood gas (ABG) differences were evaluated according to time of day.\\nResults: Compared to the GEM glucoses measured between 0200 and 0800, the run charts of (GEM-CL) glucose demonstrate significant outliers between 0800 and 0200 which are identified as moderate to severe clinical outliers by SEG analysis (P < .002 and P < .0005 for 5- and 15-minute intervals). Over the entire 24-hour period, the rates of moderate to severe glucose clinical outliers are 3.5/1000 (GEM) and 0.6/1000 glucoses (ABL), respectively, using the 15-minute interval (P < .0001).\\nDiscussion: The GEM ABG glucose is associated with a higher frequency of moderate to severe glucose clinical outliers, especially between 0800 and 0200, increased CL testing and higher average patient glucoses.',\n",

Sixty paired serum (plus gel separator), lithium-heparin (plus gel separator) and K2-EDTA tubes were centrifuged within 30 min from collection. Thirty serum and lithium-heparin tubes were then stored at RT, whilst the other 30 serum and lithium-heparin tubes were kept at 4 °C. Complete cell blood count was performed in serum and plasma after centrifugation, as well as in K2-EDTA paired whole blood tubes. Glucose was measured immediately after centrifugation and 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h afterwards. Immeasurable blood cells values were found in serum, whilst residual leukocytes and platelets were present in lithium-heparin plasma. Regardless of storage conditions, glucose concentration decreased 3 h after centrifugation in lithium-heparin tubes, displaying uninterrupted reduction until 96 h. Mean decrease per hour was higher in plasma tubes stored at RT than at 4 °C. Performance specification was exceeded between 6 and 24 h of storage in most plasma tubes. Glucose concentration significantly decreased in serum tubes between 24 and 48 h, regardless of storage conditions. The mean glucose variation never exceeded performance specification throughout the study period. Mean glucose decrease per hour in plasma was not associated with blood cells counts before and after centrifugation, and was probably attributable to the presence of blood cells entrapped within the gel. Delayed glucose measurement in centrifuged serum tubes may be clinically viable up to 96 h, whilst it may be unadvisable in centrifuged lithium-heparin tubes.',\n",

Uncomplicated effusions had glucose concentrations greater than 60 mg/dl and a pleural fluid pH greater than 7.30.

Net glucose absorption averaged 182 +/- (SD) 61 g/day in 19 studies with a dialysate dextrose concentration of 1.5 or 4.25 g/dl. The amount of glucose absorbed per liter of dialysate (y) varied with the concentration of glucose in dialysate (x), (y = 11.3x - 10.9, r = 0.96). The amount of glucose absorbed per day during a given dialysis regimen was constant. Energy intake from dialysate glucose was 8.4 +/- 2.8 kcal/kg of body wt per day, or 12 to 34% of total energy intake. This additional energy may contribute to the anabolic effect reported during CAPD.

       "  'abstract': 'Glucose tolerance is determined by both insulin action and insulin-independent effects, or \"glucose effectiveness,\" which includes glucose-mediated stimulation of glucose uptake (Rd) and suppression of hepatic glucose output (HGO). Despite its importance to tolerance, controversy surrounds accurate assessment of glucose effectiveness. Furthermore, the relative contributions of glucose\\'s actions on Rd and HGO under steady state and dynamic conditions are unclear. We performed hyperglycemic clamps and intravenous glucose tolerance tests in eight normal dogs, and assessed glucose effectiveness by two independent methods. During clamps, glucose was raised to three successive 90-min hyperglycemic plateaus by variable labeled glucose infusion rate; glucose effectiveness (GE) was quantified as the slope of the dose-response relationship between steady state glucose and glucose infusion rate (GE[CLAMP(total)]), Rd (GE[CLAMP(uptake)]) or HGO (GE[CLAMP(HGO)]). During intravenous glucose tolerance tests, tritiated glucose (1.2 microCi/kg) was injected with cold glucose (0.3 g/kg); glucose and tracer dynamics were analyzed using a two-compartment model of glucose kinetics to obtain Rd and HGO components of glucose effectiveness. All experiments were performed during somatostatin inhibition of islet secretion, and basal insulin and glucagon replacement. During clamps, Rd rose from basal (2.54+/-0.20) to 3.95+/-0.54, 6.76+/-1.21, and 9.48+/-1.27 mg/min per kg during stepwise hyperglycemia; conversely, HGO declined to 2.06+/-0.17, 1.17+/-0.19, and 0.52+/-0.33 mg/min per kg. Clamp-based glucose effectiveness was 0.0451+/-0.0061, 0.0337+/-0.0060, and 0.0102+/-0.0009 dl/min per kg for GE[CLAMP(total)], GE[CLAMP(uptake)], and GE[CLAMP(HGO)], respectively. Glucose\\'s action on Rd dominated overall glucose effectiveness (72.2+/-3.3% of total), a result virtually identical to that obtained during intravenous glucose tolerance tests (71.6+/-6.1% of total). Both methods yielded similar estimates of glucose effectiveness. These results provide strong support that glucose effectiveness can be reliably estimated, and that glucose-stimulated Rd is the dominant component during both steady state and dynamic conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We compared the glucose clearance ability of gibel carp CAS III (A strain) with gibel carp Dongting (DT strain). A previous study suggested that these two strains responded to insulin differently. As insulin plays an important role in glucose utilization, we hypothesized that the ability to eliminate excess glucose after a glucose load would differ between A strain and DT strain. To test this hypothesis, fasted specimens of both strains of gibel carp were injected with glucose. As expected, glucose induced hyperglycemia in both A strain and DT strain. In both strains, mRNA levels of the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (6PFK) increased in the white skeletal muscle 8 h post-injection, while expression levels of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased in the liver 8 h post-injection. In the DT strain, both GLUT4 expression and muscular glycolytic processes increased, as reflected by elevated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase (PK) mRNA expression levels. The DT strain also returned to basal glycemia more quickly than the A strain (within 6 h versus more than 12 h). The glycogen concentration in the liver of the DT strain was higher than that of the A strain, indicating that the DT strain was better able to store glucose as glycogen than the A strain. Overall, the DT strain was better able to clear excess blood glucose after the glucose tolerance test than the A strain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Approaches measuring futile cycling of glucose and fructose-6-phosphate (fructose-6-P) in liver in vivo depend on assumptions about the fates of hydrogens bound to specific carbons of glucose. Thus, 3H of [2-3H]glucose has been assumed to be completely removed after its conversion to glucose-6-P, [3-3H]glucose after its conversion to fructose-1,6-bisP, and [6-3H]glucose not at all. Previous measurements have shown that these assumptions are incompletely fulfilled. Corrections to estimates of cycling can be made when detritiations of [2-3H]glucose and [3-3H]glucose are not complete, and detritiation of [6-3H]glucose occurs. How the corrections can be made is presented using data previously reported on giving labeled glucoses to humans after an overnight fast and on infusing a glucose load. Estimates of glucose cycling nearly double, and that of fructose-6-P cycling almost triples. Estimates of hepatic glucose production as measured with [6-3H]glucose decrease. Correction of estimates of cycling under other conditions may very well be similarly affected. Thus, rates of glucose and fructose-6-P cycling appear to be substantially more than previously estimated. Quantitation under a given condition requires measurements to be made of the extent to which assumptions as to the fate of labeled hydrogen of the glucoses are fulfilled. The uncertain extent of exchange of label catalyzed by transaldolase and detritiation in the pentose cycle, the failure of fructose-6-P cycling to be expressed through detritiation of 3H from [3-3H]glucose, and possible isotope effects still limit the confidence that can be placed in such estimates.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hyperglycemia is often seen in trauma patients and its etiology is not clearly understood. We have determined parameters of glucose metabolism by using simultaneous primed-constant intravenous infusion of both [6-3H] glucose and [U-14C] glucose in ten severely traumatized hypermetabolic subjects during the early \"flow phase\" of injury and in six post-absorptive normal volunteers. The mean rate of glucose production (determined by means of [6-3H] glucose) was 3.96 +/- 0.40 mg/kg/min in trauma patients, which was significantly (p = 0.025) higher than the value of 2.75 +/- 0.13 observed in normal volunteers. Glucose turnover rates determined with [U-14C] glucose as tracer were lower in all subjects. The difference between the turnover rates determined by the two tracers represents an index of recycling of glucose through three-carbon fragments. This recycling index was similar in both groups of subjects in amount (0.24 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.08 mg glucose/kg/min) but different when expressed as percentage of total glucose turnover (5.6 +/- 1.4% vs. 9.8 +/- 1.7%; p = 0.05). The absolute rates of glucose clearance, oxidation, and recycling were similar in stressed trauma patients and unstressed controls although the rate of production was increased by 44% due to injury. Post-trauma hyperglycemia was mainly due to an increased hepatic output of glucose and not due to a decreased ability of the tissue to extract glucose from the plasma. Hyperglycemia may be the driving force in the metabolic effects of injury.',\n",

The findings were compared with previously published tensors, as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments and single molecule DFT calculations. A cluster approach was adopted, in which intermolecular interactions (predominantly hydrogen bonds) between the radical species and its environment were explicitly incorporated. This substantially improved the correspondence with experimental findings in comparison with single molecule calculations of an earlier examination. In a direct comparison between both computational methods for the glucose radicals, it was shown that the extent of the model space plays an important part in the determination of the radical geometry. Furthermore, the model space also has an impact on the calculated hyperfine coupling tensors. Full cluster EPR calculations, in which the paramagnetic properties are calculated for the entire model space of the cluster, give an excellent agreement with the experimental EPR measurements.',\n",

A prerequisite for an artificial pancreas is fast and reliable glucose sensing. However, subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring carries the disadvantage of slow dynamics. As an alternative, we explored continuous glucose sensing in the peritoneal space, and investigated potential spatial differences in glucose dynamics within the peritoneal cavity. As a secondary outcome, we compared the glucose dynamics in the peritoneal space to the subcutaneous tissue.\\nMaterial and methods: Eight-hour experiments were conducted on 12 anesthetised non-diabetic pigs. Four commercially available amperometric glucose sensors (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd., Witney, UK) were inserted in four different locations of the peritoneal cavity and two sensors were inserted in the subcutaneous tissue. Meals were simulated by intravenous infusions of glucose, and frequent arterial blood and intraperitoneal fluid samples were collected for glucose reference.\\nResults: No significant differences were discovered in glucose dynamics between the four quadrants of the peritoneal cavity. The intraperitoneal sensors responded faster to the glucose excursions than the subcutaneous sensors, and the time delay was significantly smaller for the intraperitoneal sensors, but we did not find significant results when comparing the other dynamic parameters.\",\n",
